# Database-Systems-Enhancement-Project
Simulated database issues causing application workflow failures, then used SQL queries (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) to identify and correct faulty or missing records. Validated data integrity after fixes and documented each resolution step, creating a comprehensive knowledge base for future reference.

üìå Overview  
This project simulates **real-world application support issues** such as missing data and duplicate records.  
It demonstrates how a **Technical Solution Analyst** can:  
- Identify issues using SQL queries  
- Apply fixes with `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations  
- Validate data integrity after changes  
- Document resolutions in a knowledge base style log  

This project showcases **SQL troubleshooting, problem-solving, and documentation skills** relevant to application support and incident management roles.  

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Database:** SQLite (can easily switch to MySQL/PostgreSQL)  
- **Concepts:** Troubleshooting, SQL queries (SELECT/UPDATE), data validation, incident documentation
